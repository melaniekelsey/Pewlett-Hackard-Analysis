Pewlett-Hackard Employee Database Project

Overview of Analysis:
I was tasked with creating a DB for Pewlett_Hackard employees to determine an estimated number of retiring employees and their info. 
Additionally, I was asked to identify which employees would be eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

Results:
After compiling and querying all the data, I was able to determine four major points.

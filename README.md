# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Project: Pewlett-Hackard Employee Database analysis to forecast retiring associates

For this project, I was tasked with compiling an employee database with SQL of Pewlett-Hackard employees and to ultimately create a list of potential retiring employees based on birthdate. 

Additionally, I was asked to determine a list of employees who would be mentorship eligible based on a birthdate in the year of 1965.

## Results

In examining all of the data and pulling multiple different queries, I have determined 4 major datapoints that I would like to discuss. 

### What titles are retirement eligible? 
Based on birthdate, I determined that there are 90,398 potential retirees. When we look at those people and their current titles. this is a potential breakdown of what roles will need to be filled in the near future.

As you can see from the image above, the two roles with the highest amount of potential retirees are the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions. This is providing you with the opportunity to promote Assistant Engineers and Staff associates to these roles. This is the perfect time to start having conversations with the less senior associates to work on stretch assignments to prepare them for possible promotions in the future. No time like the present to start training these less senior associates to take on more responsibilities. 

### What is the salary range for the retiring associates?
When you breakdown the different salary ranges for the potential retirees, the highest percentage of retirees are in the lowest salary ranges. I think that this is important to look at to forecast salary and budgets for the future. Maybe it's time to start looking at compensation and determine if there are any lower paying roles that can be eliminated and work that can be redistributed to more senior associates.

### What is the gender breakdown of retirees?
When you look at breakdown of potential retirees, there are more males than females that are currently on the list. 54,140 males and 36,258 females are slated to retire. This is a great opportunity to move more females into leadership roles.

### Who is eligible for mentorship?
There are 1549 associates eligible for mentorship, spread across 6 different roles. With the highest numbers currently with the title of Senior Staff and Engineer. As discussed above, there are a number of potential retirees in Senior Staff and Senior Engineer roles. this is a perfect opportunity for them to relay their knowledge and mentor potential replacement leaders to prepare them for their bright future at Pewlett-Hackard.

Additionally, there are a number of staff and Assistant Engineers with mentorship eligibility. With the proper mentorship and guidance, this could be a great opportunity to give them stretch assignments to prepare them for potential promotions and to help take on the gaps that will be left when higher ups retire in the near future. 

#### Summary
In summary, there is a lot of work to be done to prepare for the "silver tsunami" enroute toward Pewlett-Hackard. With 90,398 potential retirees, Pewlett-Hackard needs to start working on preparing the non-retirees to take on more responsibility and work towards promotions in the near future. 

In that same vein, the potential retirees need to be tasked with mentoring and determining potential backfills for their roles. They could make a really good dent if a strategic plan was made to work with the 1549 mentorship eligible associates. It will take work on both sides to facilitate the knowledge share and for the mentees to really push themselves to make them ready to take on extra responsiblities. 

On another note, I think it is important to look to fill the less senior roles. Inevitably, the less senior associates will get promoted and ultimately need new employees to take on their responsibilities. In addition to creating a mentorship program for the more senior associates, it might be worth it to set one in motion for the less senior associates as well. Career pathing at every level, creates more job satisfaction and helps keep your employees engaged and driving towards higher roles within the company.
